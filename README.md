# Assignment B: The Synthesizer Project

In this assignment, you will start with a fully-written code of a synthesizer. However, the synthesizer does not work as
expected. The previous programmer didn't learn about real-time systems and is inefficiently organizing task execution in
an infinite loop, a *superloop* in the embedded jargon. Your task is to fix and improve the code, such that the
synthesizer works correctly, producing clear sound, without any clipping or clicking.
